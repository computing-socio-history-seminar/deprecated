# 🖳 About

The **Computing Socio-History Seminar** is a research seminar organized by the [HT2S research center](https://technique-societe.cnam.fr/histoire-des-technosciences-en-societe-ht2s--913760.kjsp) of the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers. Every two months, we invite a researcher in the history and/or sociology of computing to present their work. The seminar aims to explore new narratives of computing history over extended periods of time, with an emphasis on how computer science intersects with social, economic, political, and cultural matters.
